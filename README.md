# Idle - A clicker game 

I started this as a way to refresh and learn more about React and related libraries.

What I have learned so far
---
* yarn as the new package manager/script runner

To Try it out
---
In the project directory, you can run:
#### `npm start` or `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
#### `npm test` or `yarn test`
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
